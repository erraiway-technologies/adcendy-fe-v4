      question: 'What counts as one market?',
      answer:
        "One market is one country. One strategy covers one country, end to end — the competitors in it, the searches your buyers run in it, and the openings inside it. We work at national level only: we don't build city or state strategies, because the competitor advertising data we read is published at country level, so a city strategy would be national data wearing a local label. What your city does contribute is real — what buyers near you actually search, and which competitors hold presence where you are, get read and folded into the national strategy. Selling into more than one country means more than one market, and we quote that package with you.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How is this different from an AI tool?',
      answer:
        "Generic tools generate from patterns — they don't know your actual competitors or what's moving in your market right now. We analyze your real market first, and the strategy is built on what we find. Then a human strategist validates it before it reaches you.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have a website yet?",
      answer:
        "We have a structured intake path for pre-website founders. We'll capture your offer, audience, and goals through a guided form and look at what the market already says about you and your competitors.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it actually take?',
      answer:
        `We deliver ${deliveryWindowLabel()} of confirming your inputs are complete. That is a written commitment in our Delivery Policy, not an estimate. ` +
        (isPilot
          ? "During the pilot we deliberately cap how many strategies we take on at once so this timeline holds — if we're at capacity when you order, we'll tell you the honest turnaround before you pay, not after."
          : "If we're ever at capacity when you order, we'll tell you the honest turnaround before you pay, not after."),
    },
    {
      question: "What if the strategy doesn't fit my business?",
      answer:
        `You get ${revisionRoundsLabel()} included.` +
        (isPilot
          ? ` During the pilot, the pilot guarantee also applies: ${PILOT_GUARANTEE_TEXT}`
          : ""),
    },
    {
      question: 'Will you execute the strategy for me?',
      answer:
        `No — and that's deliberate. We're the direction, not the hands. The strategy is built for your team (in-house marketers, freelancers, or an agency) to own and run. Every market includes ${TERMS.guidedSupportDays} days of guided support, in writing — a kickoff, a check on your numbers against the plan's targets, and a final review — so your team isn't on its own while they execute. If you have no way to execute yet, we're probably not the right first step.`,
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with international clients?',
      answer:
        "Yes. We work with businesses anywhere in the world, in whichever country their buyers are. Prices are shown for where you are, and the deliverable is the same everywhere. Each country is a separate market — see \"What counts as one market?\" above.",
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-industries',
      question: 'What industries do you specialize in?',
      answer:
        "Three: SaaS, D2C e-commerce, and established coaches or consultants who have a team or freelancers to execute. We've intentionally narrowed to deliver real depth in each — and since a strategy only works if you have the hands to run it, we focus on businesses with execution capacity, not solo operators.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Who actually reviews my strategy?',
      answer:
        "Every strategy is reviewed by an experienced marketer before delivery — nothing ships without passing that review. As we grow, we're building out the review bench so that standard holds as volume increases.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens to my data?',
      answer:
        "Your business information is used only to build your strategy. We don't sell or share data, and you can request deletion at any time.",
    },
